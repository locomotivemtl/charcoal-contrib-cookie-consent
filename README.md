Charcoal Cookie Consent
=======================

[![License][badge-license]](./LICENSE)
[![Latest stable version][badge-version]](https://packagist.org/packages/locomotivemtl/charcoal-contrib-cookie-consent)
[![Supported PHP versions][badge-php]](./composer.json)

The [Charcoal][charcoal/charcoal] Cookie Consent package provides
an integration with [vanilla-cookieconsent] for a simple cross-browser
plugin written in vanilla JS that is configurable from the Admin.

## Installation

```shell
composer require locomotivemtl/charcoal-contrib-cookie-consent
```

### Setup

#### Charcoal Module

For Charcoal projects, the module can be registered from your configuration file:

```json
{
    "modules": {
        "charcoal/cookie-consent/cookie-consent": {}
    }
}
```

The module will automatically register the service provider, the metadata path,
and the [Admin][charcoal/admin] dashboard routing.

#### Charcoal Service Provider

If you are not using the module, the service provider can be registered
from your configuration file:

```json
{
    "service_providers": {
        "charcoal/cookie-consent/cookie-consent": {}
    }
}
```

Consult the [package configuration files](./config) for what to add to your project.

## Models

After the module or service provider has been registered, create the database table
for the primary model for configuring and disclosing cookie consent information:

```shell
./vendor/bin/charcoal admin/object/table/create --obj-type=charcoal/cookie-consent/model/disclosure
./vendor/bin/charcoal admin/object/table/create --obj-type=charcoal/cookie-consent/model/category
```

## Configuration

            // See available options below.
        }
    }
}
```

Alternatively, it can be configured via your application configuration:
